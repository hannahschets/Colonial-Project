## Servitude in the Colonial Period
### Indentured Servitude
- The first indentured servants arrived to Virginia in 1624
- It was typical for indentured servants to be bound for three to five years after their arrival in the colonies
- Many times, someone would agree to an indenture contract because they could not afford the cost of transportation to the Americas
    - Some people were "spirited" or kidnapped to be taken to the New World and sold into servitude (Snyder)
